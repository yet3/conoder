A very in-development app that lets you make code presentations by arranging and connecting nodes.

This project, as previously stated is in very early stages. I wanted to quickly make a basic version to see whether I want to put more time into making something more polished.

You can play around with it here: [conoder.vercel.app](https://conoder.vercel.app/)
